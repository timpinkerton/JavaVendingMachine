# JavaVendingMachine
Java Vending Machine Project

This is a Java console application that is designed to emulate a vending machine.  The project was created to practice Java
using the MVC patter, dependency injection, user input/output, BigDecimal, unit testing, and enums.

When starting the app, the user will be presented with 5 items to choose from.  The user can enter $0.01 up to $20.  The app 
will validate the amount of money the user enters and then prompt the user to select an item to be dispensed.   The app will 
validate the user selection and display an error message if the user entered an invalid selection, tries to select an item 
that is out of stock, or did not enter enough money to purchase the selected item.

## This application was creating using: 

* Java 8
* NetBeans
* Spring Framework
* AspectJ
* JUnit Tests
